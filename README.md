## Introduction
This project aims to clean and analyze the Lending Club dataset to ensure data quality and integrity. By identifying and handling outliers, visualizing data trends, and exploring categorical variables, the study sets a foundation for future predictive modeling or statistical analysis.

## Data Cleaning Process
The following steps are performed in the notebook:
- Removing outliers from numerical variables (e.g., `annual_inc`, `dti`, `loan_amnt`, `funded_amnt_inv`).
- Checking the distributions of numerical variables to ensure data quality.
- Identifying columns where outliers need to be addressed or can be left as-is based on business understanding.

## Visualizing Categorical Data
The notebook includes exploratory data analysis (EDA) to better understand categorical variables. Visualizations help in identifying patterns and potential relationships among variables.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository or download the notebook file.
2. Ensure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed.
3. Install necessary libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
    ```
4. Open the notebook in Jupyter and execute the cells.

## Results
- Improved data quality by handling outliers and understanding data distributions.
- Visualization of categorical variables provided insights into data patterns.
